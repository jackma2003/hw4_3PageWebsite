            <p>The devastating eruption of war in Ukraine is driving millions from their homes and now, the consequences of the conflict are radiating outwards, triggering a wave of hunger in the immediate region and around the world.

The United Nations World Food Programme is on the ground right now providing critical food assistance to people affected by conflict in places like Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia.

Your gift will make a lifesaving difference today for families affected by conflict around the world: $75 can provide a family with an emergency box containing enough food for an entire month.

You have the power to save lives. Make your 100% tax-deductible charitable donation now.

            <p>UNICEF continues to work with governments and other local partners in host countries to provide health care, education and other support services to Ukrainian refugees.

Through these efforts, for example, UNICEF has helped over 500,000 refugee women and children access primary health care and over 1.4 million children have received education support, formally or informally, including early learning.

Nearly 1.7 million children and caregivers have been reached with mental health and psychosocial support services, made even more accessible through the 36 Blue Dots, refugee support centers set up along major transit routes.

Messages on preventing violence and exploitation — including human trafficking — and how to access to emergency relief services have reached over 10 million people.

UNICEF reports details of its response and impact for refugee children and families in Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and many other countries in situation reports posted here. 

Help UNICEF continue to save and protect Ukraine's most vulnerable children and families. Ongoing programs remain underfunded. Your tax-deductible contribution can make a difference. Donate today.
